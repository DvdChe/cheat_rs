# cheat_rs 🦀
cheat_rs is a blazing fast, asynchronous CLI tool written in Rust. It leverages Google's Gemini AI to generate Linux commands from natural language prompts directly in your terminal.

Stop context-switching to your browser to search for `openssl` flags or `ffmpeg` syntax. Just ask.

**Note:** This project is a learning playground where I'm experimenting with Rust.
